# MarketingGuildConstitution
This is the Bankless Marketing Guild Constitution. In order to make updates to the constitution easier, we want to handle them like code updates. With Github we have the possibilities to suggest and implement in a structured and easy way. Please head over to the "bDAO_Marketing_Consitution" to see the main document or head over to: https://www.notion.so/bankless/Marketing-Guild-Constitution-b9a9abd2a0444a5685ff4d64f1c22679

## How to propose changes to the Constitution
Create a Pull Request on GitHub to signal what specific changes are needed. Once complete, discussions within the Guild should be held around that planned change
Once soft-consensus is found, a vote for the "Constitution Amendment" can be started (Voting Restriction: bDAO Level 1 or higher)

## Constitution History
The v1 of the constitution was introduced during Season 4 and the original document can be found here: https://mirror.xyz/voellmy.eth/w8lxWcNs1eWj2l6PQqJUrazg25xsUHZQonb3gFM1PlY
