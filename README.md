# MarketingGuildConstitution
This is the v1 of the Bankless Marketing Guild Constitution. We want to make updates to the consitution easier

## How to propose changes to the Constitution
Create a Pull Request on GitHub to signal what specific changes are needed. Once complete, discussions within the Guild should be held around that planned change
Once soft-consensus is found, a vote for the "Constitution Amendment" can be started (Voting Restriction: bDAO Level 1 or higher)
